                <p>
                    Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

                <h2>Discrete Math</h2>

                <p>
                    Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic– do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers. More formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets.

                <h2>Networking</h2>
                <p>
                    A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. ... Two very common types of networks include: Local Area Network (LAN) Wide Area Network (WAN). handling input and output, and controlling peripheral.
